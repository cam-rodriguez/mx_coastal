# data
this includes:
- csv files breaking down the different pixel area counts 
  - one that's raw/just entered & one that is transposed w/ a little analysis and honestly should be cleaned before using for any sort of viz
- shp of geometries used in the supervised classification
  - is the merge between built and non-built land
  - if it doesn't work for you/isn't replicable then pop it in issues
